## 📜 Intro

**Hero** is a browser window emulator for Rust-based WASM frameworks like **Yew**, **Leptos**, and **Dioxus**. Designed to wrap embedded content in a mock browser frame, it offers complete control over styling, layout, and interactions.

## 🤔 Why Use Hero?

1. **🖼️ Realistic Browser Look**: Simulates a browser window with address bar, controls (close, minimize, maximize), and content area.

1. **🔩 Highly Configurable**: Toggle visibility, customize styles, and control behavior with dozens of props.

1. **📟 Accessible by Default**: Comes with semantic roles and ARIA attributes for screen readers and keyboard users.

1. **⚡ Interactive Hooks**: Emit callbacks on user actions like URL change, hover, click, blur, focus, and keyboard events.

1. **🎛️ Theming-Ready and Style-Agnostic**: Comes with sensible defaults but is easily styled via Tailwind, CSS classes, or inline styles.
